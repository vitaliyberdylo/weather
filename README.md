==================================================

This is just demo application for using the [VitberWeatherBundle](https://github.com/vitaliyberdylo/WeatherBundle).
By default this application gets data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) api.
Please create your own account on http://openweathermap.org website and configure application your api_key.
To use the application for demo purposes, just add your Openweathermap API key to ``env.local``.

```text

```

That's all. Now you can find out the weather for a list of cities presented for demonstration purposes.
All necessary documentation with configuration and extension examples can be found
in the [VitberWeatherBundle documentation](https://github.com/vitaliyberdylo/WeatherBundle/blob/main/docs/index.md).
